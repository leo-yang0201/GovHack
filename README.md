Description:Through wrangling and analysis of data about school location, school zone and enrollment of every school in Victoria State, as well as the birth and migration rate of each region, our product provides two interfaces to offer solutions for both parents and education system, including government and schools. Visualizing school info on an interactive map, parents can easily learn which school zone they are in, whether a school is public, catholic or specialist, and the quality of it. Besides, with SpotSchool, schools are able to know projected future demands and react proactively and collectively to better manage enrollment pressure within the Victoria state.

Data Story:Many softwares such as Python, Tableau, BDP, Excel and Java are utilized to capture, process, and analyze data. The data of school location is used to mark every single school on the map. Combined with enrollment history and zone information of each school, we predict the capacity of schools. Utilizing historical school size of past six years, we also predict the future trend of school capacity through regression models. Besides, the data of birth and migration rate of each region is utilized, to predict the demand trend for school in each region. Also, the detailed school information, including the ranking, is also included into our final solutions. With all the data, parents can have a clear idea of the closest school option and other alternative for their children. At the same time, schools can be better informed and prepared to manage class size given predicted enrollment pressure.
